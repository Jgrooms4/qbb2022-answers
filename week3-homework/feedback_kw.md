  * good --> +1

2. align reads

  * good; this is what you would do for each of the 10 samples

3. sort bam files and index sorted bam files (0.5 points each)



4. variant call with freebayes



5. filter variants



6. decompose complex haplotypes



7. variant effect prediction



8. python plotting script
