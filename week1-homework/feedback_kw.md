# Week 1 Genome Assembly -- Feedback

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0.9075 + 1 + 1 = 8.91 points out of 10 possible point

1. Question 1.1, 1.4 how many reads (0.5 pts each)

  * good --> +1

2. Question 1.2, 1.4 simulation script(s)

  * you want to pick a random number from 0 to 999900 not from 100 to 999900.
  * consider having one script for the simulation where you change the number of reads that are simulated, etc. using `sys.argv`

3. Question 1.2, 1.4 plotting script(s)

  * good --> +1

4. Question 1.2, 1.4 histograms with overlaid Poisson distributions (0.5 pts each)

  * good work overall --> + 1
  * if you would like a height matchup with the poisson distribution and the histogram, you could change the number of bins used in the histogram to match the number of unique coverage whole number values plotted/represented in the dataset
  * Consider changing the plot titles in order to distinguish the 5x from the 15x coverage

5. Question 1.3, 1.4 how much of genome not sequenced/comparison to Poisson expectations (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * don't see the observed number or expectation for Poisson --> +0

6. Question 2 De novo assembly (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * number of contigs --> +0.5
  * total length of contigs --> +0.5

7. Question 2 De novo assembly cont (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * size of largest contig --> +0.5
  * contig n50 size --> +0.5

8. whole genome alignment (0.33 pts each, 0.33/2 for answer and 0.33/2 for code)

  * average identity --> +0.33
  * length of longest alignment --> +0.33
  * how many insertions and deletions in assembly --> how many deletions? --> 0.2475 (+ 0.33/4 for half answer + 0.33/2 for explanation/code)

9. decoding the insertion (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * position of insertion in assembly --> +0.5
  * length of novel insertion --> +0.5

10. decoding the insertion cont (0.5 pts each, 0.25 for answer and 0.25 for code)

  * DNA sequence of encoded message --> +0.5
  * secret message --> +0.5

We worked through questions 9 and 10 together, so I graded based on that, not on what's in the README file.
