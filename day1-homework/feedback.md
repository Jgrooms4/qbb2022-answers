1. You have the correct answer. It would be nice to have a little more explanation of what was wrong and how you fixed it. Think of it as showing your work.

2. This looks good. The choice of what state constitutes a promoter is a bit subjective but your explanation of the set you choice makes good sense.

3. The first error message had to do with a non-tab delimited input file. You solved it by explicitly formatting the print statement. Alternatively, you could specify that the output field separator (OFS) should be a tab. `awk 'BEGIN{ OFS="\t"}...' The rest of the script looks good and you have the correct answers.

Overall, you appear to be quite comfortable with the various bash commands we've been using as well as chaining them together for more complex analyses. Great work, and keep it up!
