Awesome start! You didn't upload your plots, but I ran your code and your plots look great! Nice work labeling the axes, as well. In the future though, please upload the actual plots themselves, it makes our jobs easier. There are a few more things we need from you before this is complete:

1. The plink commands you used for PCA, AF, and linear regression (-1.5 points)
2. Your boxplot (and code) (-1.5 points)
3. Your answer to question 7 (-1 point)

Great work so far!
