# day 4 homework feedback

Please submit your code

Your heatmaps are good!

(Completely optional feedback: Do you like having the values displayed such that the y-axis goes from the top down, increasing number of coin tosses as you move down the axis? and relatedly, such that the x-axis goes from the left to the right, decreasing the probability of heads as you move across the axis? If you store the probability of heads in the rows (first axis) and the number of tosses in the columns (second axis) in your numpy 2d storage array, will the axes be displayed differently and more intuitively?)

Good comments in your README for A. I didn't see any comments for part C describing what you observe with your heatmaps. I also didn't see any comments comparing to the real study.
