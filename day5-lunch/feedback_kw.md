## Exercise 1

please add the code/commands that were used to wrangle and join the data in Unix.

## Exercise 2

### 1 -- data input

Good job

### 2 -- scatter plots

The maternal scatter plot is blank -- this could be because `#plt.scatter(fam["M_age"], fam["m_count"])` is commented out and doesn't seem to have its own plotting section, being included with the histogram code, but that's in the README, not a script, so I'm not certain.

Good plot labels overall

### 3 & 4 -- OLS

Good job overall. I'd recommend reporting the p-values in the future

also, I only see the code for the paternal OLS, not the maternal one. please include if possible

### 5 -- histogram

Good histogram!

### 6 -- ttest

good work. I'd recommend reporting the p-value in the future.

### 7 -- predict

Very nice use of the predict function!
