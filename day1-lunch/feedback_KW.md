## Feedback for day1-lunch from KW

### Exercise 2

* b (Mean): Nice and a bit of python making a guest appearance

* c (Median): That's going to find the median length of exons. What information would you need to find the median number of exons per gene?

### Exercise 3

* b (Tally): Great work finding the tally

* c (Fraction): While state 7 might have the highest count, this question is related to the idea that the states might not uniformly cover the genome. So we'd want to use the 2nd and 3rd columns to look at the length of each region and the overall fraction of the genome that each state covers

### Exercise 4

* b (Tally): Good work

* c (All super populations): Yes -- fantastic plan

### Exercise 5

* b (HG00100.vcf): Good work making the file

* c (genotypes): Fantastic job removing the header and getting the genotypes

* d (AF): Nice

* e (AFR_AF): Yeah good work. Do you think it would work if you tried using grep with `AFR_AF`?
