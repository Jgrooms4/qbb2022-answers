All of this looks great. You seem to be comfortable and proficient using these commands and chaining them together for more complex operations. The only error I see in in 5e. "AF=1" can appear multiple times since you can have the fields "AF=1", "EAS_AF=1", "EUR_AF=1", etc.

Great work so far and keep it up!
